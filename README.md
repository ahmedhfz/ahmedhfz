Hi there! 👋 I'm Ahmed Hafızoğlu

I’m a first-year AI enthusiast and software engineering student with a growing passion for machine learning and artificial intelligence. 🌟 My journey in the world of technology has just begun, and I’m driven by a curiosity to understand how data shapes the world around us. 🚀

Currently, I’m building a strong foundation in Python and exploring libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to analyze and visualize data. Alongside these, I am delving into scikit-learn to craft machine learning models and better understand their inner workings. I’m also comfortable working with PostgreSQL, which I use to manage and query complex datasets.

My focus is on developing machine learning and deep learning projects that can address real-world challenges and make an impact. Whether it’s predicting trends or designing intelligent systems, I’m eager to learn and contribute. 🤖

Outside of coding, I’m a passionate basketball player 🏀 and a guitar enthusiast 🎸, always seeking balance between creativity and logic.

Feel free to connect with me if you’d like to chat about technology, share ideas, or collaborate on exciting projects. Let’s shape the future together! 🌟
